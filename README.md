# SSA

## Simple Spectral Access (SSA) protocol

The Simple Spectral Access (SSA) Protocol (SSAP) defines a uniform interface to remotely discover and access one dimensional spectra.

## Current Status

The current stable IVOA Recommendation is **[REC-SSA-1.1](https://ivoa.net/documents/SSA/20120210/)** (available from [IVOA Documents Repository](https://www.ivoa.net/documents)).

In the future it is expected that this standard wiull be superceded by extensions of the [SIA2](https://github.com/ivoa-std/SIA) and [SODA](https://github.com/ivoa-std/SODA) standards. 
As a result this standard is remaining in DOC format rather than being converted to IVOATex.

Please use this repo to post issues about this specification for further revision.
